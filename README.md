# Web-based Wallet security practices

- Background:
  - Based on  [**Web-Based Self-Custody Wallets Have More Security Risks Than You Might Think (Some Are Unsolvable in the Short Term**](docs/Web-Based%20Self-Custody%20Wallets%20Have%20More%20Security%20Risks%20Than%20You%20Might%20Think.md), I think we need to try to document known security risks and hopefully find ways to mitigate them.
  - ⚠️ Note: This document focuses on security practices specific to the Web-based Self-Custody Wallet and will not cover regular web attacks ([but this section is so important that you should not overlook it if you want to learn more](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security)).
